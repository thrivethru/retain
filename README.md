An Angular 2 clone of [Google Keep](https://www.google.com/keep/) built as a demonstration of 
the [angular style guide](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/style-guide.html) with Webpack. 
This is an update and refactoring of the [retain-app](https://github.com/AngularClass/retain-app) 
from the [AngularClass' Angular Fundamentals Course](http://courses.angularclass.com/p/angular-2-fundamentals)
starting from the [Angular 2 Webpack introduction](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html#). 
It uses the api server from Angular Class.
